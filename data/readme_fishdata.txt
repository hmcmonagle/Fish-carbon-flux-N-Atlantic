## readme for fishdata.csv# written by Helena McMonagle, 2023-12-14# fishdata.csv contains the fish from the R/V Sarmiento's MOCNESS-10 and the # R/V James Cook's MOCNESS-1 collected during the North Atlantic NASA EXPORTS/# WHOI Ocean Twilight Zone Project cruise in May 2021. # We were able to calculate a weight# (or were able to use an empirical weight measurement) for all individuals. The current dataset also excludes fish smaller than 10 mm, which are generally not adult fish and have lesser known migratory behaviors and life histories compared to adults, and thus are not included in the fish carbon flux analysis that this dataset will be used for. 

# Fish collections at sea were done by Joel Llopiz, Kayla Gardner, Julia Cox, Cristina Garcia-Fernandez and Helena McMonagle on the Sarmiento and led by Deborah Steinberg and Amy Maas on the Cook. Data collection in the lab and with ImageJ was done primarily by Lyndsey Llevebre, Julia Cox and Helena McMonagle.# Column descriptions are as follows: # Ship: Ship name, either the R/V Sarmiento or RRS Cook# Tow_number: the number for the entire haul, including all nets on the MOCNESS# Net_number: the depth-stratified net associated with each tow. Note that # on the MOCNESS-1 datasheets, net 1 was defined as that which remained open # from the surface to 1000 m, whereas on the MOCNESS-10 datasheets, this net# was called net zero. Catch from net 1 on the Cook was not saved, so we were# not able to compare fish counts between the two ships for this net. This net# was not as useful in any case because it is not depth-stratified. # Taxon: taxonomic family, as it was originally written on the raw datasheets. # Fish.ID: for the smaller of the Sarmiento fish specimens, Julia Cox (Llopiz Lab)# assigned each individual fish an ID from the fish she imaged and then measured # in ImageJ. These fish were preserved in 90% ethanol prior to being photographed. # Image.Name: This corresponds to the photos taken of the smaller Sarmiento fish. # ImageJ.Number: This corresponds to the imageJ measurements taken of the smaller# Sarmiento fish. # Std_length_mm: Standard length of each fish in millimeters. # Notes: Notes that Julia Cox took while measuring the smaller Sarmiento fish.# Tow_net: used to merging volume data into the fishdata dataframe. A combination# of the tow, then net associated with each fish. # fish_no: Used to assign individual fish numbers to the larger Sarmiento fish# that were flash frozen at sea and later processed in Llopiz Lab. # packet_no: The packet that these larger fish were frozen in at sea. Information# about the contents of these packets is available in the Llopiz Lab datasheets. # Lowest_Taxon: For the larger Sarmiento fish specimens, a much lower taxonomic# level was often recorded from laboratory morphological IDs or genetic barcoding IDs. # taxa_code: Assigned by Lyndsey Llevebre (Llopiz Lab) to each fish based on taxon.# total_weight: Empirically measureed weight taken by Lyndsey Llevebre for the # larger Sarmiento specimens that were flash frozen at sea and then processed # individually in Llopiz Lab. # Date: the date that each fish was collected from the study site# TimeLocal: Local time during collection# DayNight: time of day during collection# LatitudeStart: Latitude at the start of the tow# LongitudeStart: Longitude at the start of the tow# LatitudeEnd: Latitude at the end of the tow# LongitudeEnd: Longitude at the end of the tow# MeshSize: Mesh size of each MOCNESS net system, in micrometers# VolFilt: volume filtered by each net as determined by a flowmeter connected # to the shipboard computer during MOCNESS deployment# Temp: Temperature reading associated with each tow and net, though this # was not always working on the MOCNESS so we can rely on CTD data from the same cruise# Salinity: Similar to temperature, ideally measured by MOCNESS but had some issues# with this sensor. # FracBiom: This is no longer relevant for the MOCNESS-1 samples (see split_correct_Cook below). 
# The smaller fish from the MOCNESS-10 samples that Julia measured# with ImageJ were all from quarter splits, and were multiplied by 4 accordingly. # The smaller fish from the MOCNESS-1 that Helena measured with ImageJ using Ecotaxa# images (after formalin preservation) were from various different splits, now indicated# in split_correct_Cook. 

# split_correct_Cook equals the split that Cook fish came from, if they did not come from
# a whole sample. If this was the case, these rows were replicated according to this split 
# factor for Cook fish. # Family: taxonomic family of each individual. This was the lowest taxonomic # resolution that we were able to obtain for smaller Sarmiento fish and for # all Cook fish (which were obtained exclusively from photographs for the larger# Cook fish, or from Ecotaxa images for the smaller ones that were not sorted # and photographed at sea) # estimated_weight: weight estimated from a length-weight regression for the # lowest taxon possible, where empirical weights were not available# weight.to.use: the empirical weight measured for that individual where available, # or the estimated weight from the length-weight regression where an empirical # weight measurement is not available. 


# Note from Lyndsey with a few updated taxonomic IDs on Feb 21, 2024:
#Based on genetic results from Annette and reviewing the images and ID notes, I updated the 
#following org_no from ARSP or ARLY to AROL (Argyropelecus olfersii). 

#SG2105
#org 335 ARLY to AROL based on genetics of 375 & 652 and visual ID notes
#ORG 156-160; 276-278; 280-281; 291 ARSP to AROL based on genetics, descriptions, and images# The above have now been updated in all csv files containing "fishdata" in file name (HM-March 15, 2024)
